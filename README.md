[00:04.01] ﻿[00:00.00] End of Beginning - Djo
[00:12.34] Just one more tear to cry, one teardrop from my eye
[00:16.16] You better save it for
[00:24.73] The middle of the night when things aren't black and white
[00:28.82] Enter, Troubadour
[00:37.73] "Remember 24?"
[00:44.73] 
[00:43.81] And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it
[00:49.87] Another version of me, I was in it
[01:01.13] I wave goodbye to the end of beginning
[01:20.13] 
[01:09.34] This song has started now, and you're just finding out
[01:13.13] Now isn't that a laugh?
[01:21.78] A major sacrifice, but clueless at the time
[01:25.85] Enter, Caroline
[01:30.39] "Just trust me, you'll be fine"
[01:45.89] 
[01:36.34] And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it
[01:42.39] Another version of me, I was in it
[01:46.78] I wave goodbye to the end of beginning
[01:52.78] (Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
[02:10.78] 
[01:58.78] You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man
[02:04.80] You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man
[02:10.83] You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man
[02:15.37] You take the man out of the-
[02:29.37] 
[02:21.36] And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it
[02:26.67] Another version of me, I was in it
[02:31.71] Oh, I wave goodbye to the end of beginning
[02:40.71] (Goodbye, goodbye)
