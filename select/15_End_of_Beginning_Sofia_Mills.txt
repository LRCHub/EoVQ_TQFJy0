Just one more tear to cry
One tear duct from my eye
You better save it for
The middle of the night
When things aren't black and white
Enter troubadour
Remember twenty-four
And when I'm back in Chicago I feel it
Another version of me, I wasn't it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning
The song has started now
And you're just finding out
Now isn't that a laugh?
One major sacrifice
But clueless at the time
Enter (?)
Distress me, I'll be fine
And when I'm back in Chicago I feel it
Another version of me, I wasn't it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You take the man out of the city
Not the city out the man
You take the man out of the city
Not the city out the man
You take the man out of the city
Not the city out the man
You take the man out of the
And when I'm back in Chicago I feel it
Another version of me, I wasn't it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
And when I'm back in Chicago I feel it
Another version of me, I wasn't it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
