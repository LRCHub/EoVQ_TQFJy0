Just one more tear to cry
One teardrop from my eye
You better save it for
The middle of the night
When things aren't
black-and-white
Enter, Troubadour:
"Remember 24?"
And when I'm back in
Chicago, I feel it
Another version of me,
I was in it
I wave goodbye
to the end of beginning
This song has started now
And you're just finding out
Now isn't that a laugh?
A major sacrifice,
but clueless at the time
Enter, Caroline:
"Just trust me, you'll be fine"
And when I'm back in
Chicago I feel it
Another version of me,
I was in it
I wave goodbye
to the end of beginning
(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
You take the man
out of the city,
not the city out the man
You take the man
out of the city,
not the city out the man
You take the man
out of the city,
not the city out the man
You take the man out of the
And when I'm back in
Chicago, I feel it
Another version of me,
I was in it
I wave goodbye
to the end of beginning
(Goodbye)
(Goodbye)
